    "In this report, we will be visualizing baby name data from the US over the past century. The data for this project has been provided by the United States Social Security Administration. With this data, Pandas dataframes will be used to organize name counts by state, year, and sex. Using the dataframe, the data will then be visualized using Plotly Express. The two types of plots used are line graphs and choropleth maps. The line graphs will illustrate a change in name frequency or diversity over time, while the choropleth maps will allow this data to be visualized on a state-by-state basis.\n",

    "Upon analyzing the data provided by the Social Security Administration, it is clear that the popularity of certain names has changed over time. Americans have also become more creative with their naming, as the number of different baby names has steadily increased over time. Thanks to the tools provided by pandas and Plotly Express, this data could be easily processed and presented in a way that is easily digestible without having to read through thousands of rows of data. Plots such as choropleth maps allow us to take visualization further by breaking down data geographically by state."
